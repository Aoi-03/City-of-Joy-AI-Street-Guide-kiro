# The Local Guide: Kolkata (City of Joy)

## 1. Core Identity & Vibe
* **Atmosphere:** Colonial architecture, slow-paced trams, artistic passion, and crowded but friendly streets.
* **The "Adda":** A long, informal conversation among friends, usually over tea. The app must have an "Adda Mode" or include tea-stall locations.
* **Visual Palette:** Yellow taxi colors (#fcdb03), terracotta red, and vintage off-white.

## 2. The Kolkata Slang Dictionary (The "Boli")
*Kiro should use these for the Slang Translator feature.*

| Slang / Word | Meaning | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lyadh** | Creative procrastination | "I'm feeling lyadh today" (Essential Kolkata concept). |
| **Aantel** | Intellectual / Pretentious | Someone who over-analyzes art or cinema. |
| **Byapar** | Matter / Affair | "Chhowa-chhowi byapar" (A touchy matter). |

## 3. Street Food Intelligence (The "Pet-Pujo")

## 4. Local Logistics (The "Jugaad" Guide)
* **Trams:** The only city in India with a tram network. Slow but nostalgic.
* **Yellow Taxis:** No AC, mostly manual, but iconic. Always check the meter or use the "No-Refusal" taxi logic.
* **Metro:** India’s first metro. Very clean and the lifeline of the city.
* **The "Jugaad" Tip:** If a bus is full, stand on the footboard (not recommended, but very local).

## 5. App Feature Logic (Constraints for Kiro)
* **Constraint 1:** The app must translate English feelings into Kolkata Slang (e.g., "I am tired" -> "Lyadh lagchhe").
* **Constraint 2:** The "Food Finder" must prioritize "Old Kolkata" (North) for sweets and "Park Street" (Central) for cafes.
* **Constraint 3:** Use Bengali script (Bangla) alongside English for all headers to maintain cultural authenticity.
